The relationship listcontainer is useful when you need to keep your
relationships in a certain order.  Other than having the listcontainer API
rather than the container API, there is no real difference: all the search APIs
are identical.  Note that the search result order is unaffected by the
order within the relationship listcontainer: the order only affects the 
order in which relationships are iterated.

What follows is an adapted version of the container tests.

The relationship listcontainer holds IRelationship objects. It includes an API to
search for relationships and the objects to which they link, transitively and
intransitively.  The relationships are objects in and of themselves, and they
can themselves be related as sources or targets in other relationships.

The package currently only contains an intid variant of the listcontainer.
The class in the shared module would make it easy to have other approaches, if
desired.

We'll assume that there is an application named `app` with 30 objects in it
(named 'ob0' through 'ob29') that we'll be relating.

Creating a relationship container is easy.  We'll use an abstract
ListContainer, but typically you would import it from the intid module.

    >>> from zc.relationship import interfaces
    >>> container = ListContainer()
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> verifyObject(interfaces.IRelationshipListContainer, container)
    True

The containers can be used as parts of other objects, or as standalone local
utilities.  Here's an example of adding one as a local utilty.  Note that
relationship containers do not implement ILocalUtility by default; this is
usually done with the "utility" zcml tag or the "implements" zcml tag.  We'll
specify it here by hand.

    >>> from zope.app.component.interfaces import ILocalUtility
    >>> from zope import interface
    >>> interface.alsoProvides(container, ILocalUtility)
    >>> sm = app.getSiteManager()
    >>> package = sm['default']
    >>> package['ordered_containment_relationship'] = container
    >>> import zope.app.utility
    >>> registration = zope.app.utility.UtilityRegistration(
    ...     'ordered_containment', interfaces.IRelationshipListContainer,
    ...     package['ordered_containment_relationship'])
    >>> key = package.registrationManager.addRegistration(registration)
    >>> import zope.app.component.interfaces.registration
    >>> registration.status = (
    ...     zope.app.component.interfaces.registration.ActiveStatus)
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

Adding relationships is also easy: instantiate and add to the list using any
standard list method.

    >>> rel = Relationship((app['ob0'],), (app['ob1'],))
    >>> verifyObject(interfaces.IRelationship, rel)
    True
    >>> container.append(rel)

The relation now has 'super' and '__parent__' set to the list container, and
'next' and 'previous' set to None.

    >>> rel.super is rel.__parent__ is container
    True
    >>> rel.next is rel.previous is None
    True

The list container defines the standard elements Python list interface.  For
instance, here are some read-only examples,

    >>> container[0] is rel
    True
    >>> len(container)
    1
    >>> list(container) == [rel]
    True
    >>> rel in container
    True
    >>> 17 in container
    False

It also supports four searching methods: `findTargets`, `findSources`,
`findRelationships`, and `isLinked`.  Let's add a few more relationships and
examine some relatively simple cases.

    >>> container.extend((
    ...     Relationship((app['ob1'],), (app['ob2'],)),
    ...     Relationship((app['ob1'],), (app['ob3'],)),
    ...     Relationship((app['ob0'],), (app['ob3'],)),
    ...     Relationship((app['ob0'],), (app['ob4'],)),
    ...     Relationship((app['ob2'],), (app['ob5'],))))
    >>> transaction.commit() # this is indicative of a bug in ZODB; if you
    ... # do not do this then new objects will deactivate themselves into
    ... # nothingness when _p_deactivate is called

Now there are six direct relationships (all of the relationships point down
in the diagram):

        ob0
        | |\
      ob1 | |
      | | | |
    ob2 ob3 ob4
      |
    ob5

The relationships are in the order they were added, with next and previous
pointers.

    >>> rel.next.targets[0] is app['ob2']
    True
    >>> container[5].next is None
    True
    >>> container[5].previous.targets[0] is app['ob4']
    True
    >>> len(container)
    6

More interestingly, lets examine some of the searching methods.  What are the
direct targets of ob0?

    >>> container.findTargets(app['ob0']) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <generator object at ...>

Ah-ha! It's a generator!  Let's try that again.

    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0']))
    ['ob1', 'ob3', 'ob4']

OK, what about the ones no more than two relationships away?  We use the
`maxDepth` argument, which is the second placeful argument.

    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0'], 2))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4']

Notice that, even though ob3 is available both through one and two
relationships, it is returned only once.

Passing in None will get all related objects--the same here as passing in 3, or
any greater integer.

    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0'], None))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0'], 3))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0'], 25))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4', 'ob5']

This is true even if we put in a cycle.  We'll put in a cycle between ob5 and
ob1 and look at the results.

An important aspect of the algorithm used is that it returns closer
relationships first, which we can begin to see here.

    >>> container.append(Relationship((app['ob5'],), (app['ob1'],)))
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0'], None))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4', 'ob5']
    >>> res = list(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob0'], None))
    >>> sorted(res[:3]) # these are all one step away
    ['ob1', 'ob3', 'ob4']
    >>> res[3:] # ob 2 is two steps, and ob5 is three steps.
    ['ob2', 'ob5']

When you see the source in the targets, you know you are somewhere inside a
cycle.

    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob1'], None))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob2'], None))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob5'], None))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob5']

If you ask for objects of a distance that is not a positive integer, you'll get
a ValueError.

    >>> container.findTargets(app['ob0'], 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.findTargets(app['ob0'], -1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.findTargets(app['ob0'], 'kumquat') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: ...

The `findSources` method is the mirror of `findTargets`: given a target, it
finds all sources.  Using the same relationship tree built above, we'll search
for some sources.

    >>> container.findSources(app['ob0']) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <generator object at ...>
    >>> list(container.findSources(app['ob0']))
    []
    >>> list(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob4']))
    ['ob0']
    >>> list(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob4'], None))
    ['ob0']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob1']))
    ['ob0', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob1'], 2))
    ['ob0', 'ob2', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob1'], 3))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob1'], None))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob3']))
    ['ob0', 'ob1']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob3'], None))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2', 'ob5']
    >>> list(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob5']))
    ['ob2']
    >>> list(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob5'], maxDepth=2))
    ['ob2', 'ob1']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findSources(app['ob5'], maxDepth=3))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2', 'ob5']
    >>> container.findSources(app['ob0'], 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.findSources(app['ob0'], -1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.findSources(app['ob0'], 'kumquat') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: ...

The `findRelationships` method finds all relationships from, to, or between
two objects.  Because it supports transitive relationships, each member of the
resulting iterator is a tuple of one or more relationships.

All arguments to findRelationships are optional, but at least one of `source`
or `target` must be passed in.  A search depth defaults to one relationship
deep, like the other methods.

    >>> container.findRelationships(source=app['ob0']) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <generator object at ...>
    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(source=app['ob0']))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob4>,)>']]
    >>> list(container.findRelationships(target=app['ob0']))
    []
    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(target=app['ob3']))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>']]
    >>> list(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...         source=app['ob1'], target=app['ob3']))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>']]
    >>> container.findRelationships()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: at least one of `source` and `target` must be provided

They may also be used as positional arguments, with the order `source` and
`target`.

    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(app['ob1']))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>']]
    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(app['ob5'], app['ob1']))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob5>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>']]

`maxDepth` is again available, but it is the third positional argument now, so
keyword usage will be more frequent than with the others.  Notice that the
second path has two members: from ob1 to ob2, then from ob2 to ob5.

    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(app['ob1'], maxDepth=2))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob5>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>']]

Unique relationships are returned, rather than unique objects. Therefore,
while ob3 only has two transitive sources, ob1 and ob0, it has three transitive
paths.

    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...         target=app['ob3'], maxDepth=2))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob5>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>']]

The same is true for the targets of ob0.

    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...         source=app['ob0'], maxDepth=2))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob4>,)>']]

Cyclic relationships are returned in a special tuple that implements
ICircularRelationshipPath.  For instance, consider all of the paths that lead
from ob0.  Notice first that all the paths are in order from shortest to
longest.

    >>> res = list(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...         app['ob0'], maxDepth=None))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    >>> sorted(res[:3]) # one step away # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob4>,)>']]
    >>> sorted(res[3:5]) # two steps away # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob3>,)>']]
    >>> res[5:] # three and four steps away # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob5>,)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob5>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob5>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>']]

The very last one is circular.

Now we'll change the expression to only include paths that implement
ICircularRelationshipPath.

    >>> list(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...         app['ob0'], maxDepth=None)
    ...         if interfaces.ICircularRelationshipPath.providedBy(path))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob5>,)>',
      '<Relationship from (<Demo ob5>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>']]

Note that, because relationships may have multiple targets, a relationship
that has a cycle may still be traversed for targets that do not generate a
cycle.  The further paths will not be marked as a cycle.

Cycle paths not only have a marker interface to identify them, but include a
`cycled` attribute that is a frozenset of the one or more searches that would
be equivalent to following the cycle(s).  If a source is provided, the searches
cycled searches would continue from the end of the path.

    >>> path = [path for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...     app['ob0'], maxDepth=None)
    ...     if interfaces.ICircularRelationshipPath.providedBy(path)][0]
    >>> path.cycled
    [{'source': <Demo ob1>}]
    >>> app['ob1'] in path[-1].targets
    True

If only a target is provided, the `cycled` search will continue from the
first relationship in the path.

    >>> path = [path for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...     target=app['ob5'], maxDepth=None)
    ...     if interfaces.ICircularRelationshipPath.providedBy(path)][0]
    >>> path # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    cycle(<Relationship from (<Demo ob5>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>,
          <Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>,
          <Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob5>,)>)
    >>> path.cycled
    [{'target': <Demo ob5>}]

maxDepth can also be used with the combination of source and target.

    >>> list(container.findRelationships(
    ...      app['ob0'], app['ob5'], maxDepth=None))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [(<Relationship from (<Demo ob0>,) to (<Demo ob1>,)>,
      <Relationship from (<Demo ob1>,) to (<Demo ob2>,)>,
      <Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob5>,)>)]

As usual, maxDepth must be a positive integer or None.

    >>> container.findRelationships(app['ob0'], maxDepth=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.findRelationships(app['ob0'], maxDepth=-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.findRelationships(app['ob0'], maxDepth='kumquat')
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: ...

The `isLinked` method is a convenient way to test if two objects are linked,
or if an object is a source or target in the graph. It defaults to a maxDepth
of 1.

    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob1'])
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob2'])
    False

Note that maxDepth is pointless when supplying only one of source or target.

    >>> container.isLinked(source=app['ob29'])
    False
    >>> container.isLinked(target=app['ob29'])
    False
    >>> container.isLinked(source=app['ob0'])
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(target=app['ob4'])
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(source=app['ob4'])
    False
    >>> container.isLinked(target=app['ob0'])
    False

Setting maxDepth works as usual when searching for a link between two objects,
though.

    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob2'], maxDepth=2)
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob5'], maxDepth=2)
    False
    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob5'], maxDepth=3)
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob5'], maxDepth=None)
    True

As usual, maxDepth must be a positive integer or None.

    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob1'], maxDepth=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob1'], maxDepth=-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: maxDepth must be None or a positive integer
    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob1'], maxDepth='kumquat')
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: ...

The various listcontainer methods let you remove and rearrange relationships.

As an example, let's remove the relationship from ob5 to ob1 that we created
to make the cycle.

    >>> res = list(container.findTargets(app['ob2'], None)) # before removal
    >>> len(res)
    4
    >>> res[:2]
    [<Demo ob5>, <Demo ob1>]
    >>> sorted(repr(o) for o in res[2:])
    ['<Demo ob2>', '<Demo ob3>']
    >>> res = list(container.findSources(app['ob2'], None)) # before removal
    >>> res[0]
    <Demo ob1>
    >>> res[3]
    <Demo ob2>
    >>> sorted(repr(o) for o in res[1:3])
    ['<Demo ob0>', '<Demo ob5>']
    >>> rel = list(container.findRelationships(app['ob5'], app['ob1']))[0][0]
    >>> rel.sources
    (<Demo ob5>,)
    >>> rel.targets
    (<Demo ob1>,)
    >>> container.remove(rel)
    >>> list(container.findRelationships(app['ob5'], app['ob1']))
    []
    >>> list(container.findTargets(app['ob2'], None)) # after removal
    [<Demo ob5>]
    >>> list(container.findSources(app['ob2'], None)) # after removal
    [<Demo ob1>, <Demo ob0>]

Finally, the `reindex` method allows objects already in the container to be
reindexed.  The default implementation of the relationship objects calls this
automatically when sources and targets are changed.

To reiterate, the relationships looked like this before.

        ob0
        | |\
      ob1 | |
      | | | |
    ob2 ob3 ob4
      |
    ob5

We'll switch out ob3 and ob4, so the diagram looks like this.

        ob0
        | |\
      ob1 | |
      | | | |
    ob2 ob4 ob3
      |
    ob5

    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(app['ob1']))
    ['ob2', 'ob3']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(app['ob3']))
    ['ob0', 'ob1']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(app['ob4']))
    ['ob0']

    >>> rel = iter(container.findRelationships(
    ...     app['ob1'], app['ob3'])).next()[0]
    >>> rel.targets
    (<Demo ob3>,)

    >>> rel.targets = [app['ob4']] # this calls reindex

    >>> rel.targets
    (<Demo ob4>,)

    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(app['ob1']))
    ['ob2', 'ob4']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(app['ob3']))
    ['ob0']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(app['ob4']))
    ['ob0', 'ob1']

The same sort of thing happens if we change sources.  We'll change the
diagram to look like this.

        ob0
        | |\
      ob1 | |
      |   | |
      ob2 | ob3
      | \ |
    ob5  ob4

    >>> rel.sources
    (<Demo ob1>,)
    >>> rel.sources = (app['ob2'],) # this calls reindex
    >>> rel.sources
    (<Demo ob2>,)

    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(app['ob1']))
    ['ob2']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(app['ob2']))
    ['ob4', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(app['ob0']))
    ['ob1', 'ob3', 'ob4']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(app['ob4']))
    ['ob0', 'ob2']

Advanced Usage
==============

There are four other advanced tricks that the relationship container can do:
enable search filters; allow multiple sources and targets for a single
relationship; allow relating relationships; and exposing unresolved token
results.

Search Filters
--------------

Because relationships are objects themselves, a number of interesting usages
are possible.  They can implement additional interfaces, have annotations,
and have other attributes.  One use for this is to only find objects along
relationship paths with relationships that provide a given interface.  The
`filter` argument, allowed in `findSources`, `findTargets`,
`findRelationships`, and `isLinked`, supports this kind of use case.

For instance, imagine that we change the relationships to look like the diagram
below.  The `xxx` lines indicate a relationship that implements
ISpecialRelationship.

        ob0
        x |x
      ob1 | x
      x   | x
      ob2 | ob3
      | x |
    ob5  ob4

That is, the relationships from ob0 to ob1, ob0 to ob3, ob1 to ob2, and ob2 to
ob4 implement the special interface.  Let's make this happen first.

    >>> from zope import interface
    >>> class ISpecialInterface(interface.Interface):
    ...     """I'm special!  So special!"""
    ...
    >>> for src, tgt in (
    ...     (app['ob0'], app['ob1']),
    ...     (app['ob0'], app['ob3']),
    ...     (app['ob1'], app['ob2']),
    ...     (app['ob2'], app['ob4'])):
    ...     rel = list(container.findRelationships(src, tgt))[0][0]
    ...     interface.directlyProvides(rel, ISpecialInterface)
    ...

Now we can use `ISpecialInterface.providedBy` as a filter for all of the
methods mentioned above.

`findTargets`

    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(app['ob0']))
    ['ob1', 'ob3', 'ob4']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(
    ...     app['ob0'], filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy))
    ['ob1', 'ob3']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(
    ...     app['ob0'], maxDepth=None))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4', 'ob5']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findTargets(
    ...     app['ob0'], maxDepth=None, filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy))
    ['ob1', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4']

`findSources`

    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(app['ob4']))
    ['ob0', 'ob2']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(
    ...     app['ob4'], filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy))
    ['ob2']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(
    ...     app['ob4'], maxDepth=None))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(
    ...     app['ob4'], maxDepth=None, filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2']
    >>> sorted(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(
    ...     app['ob5'], maxDepth=None))
    ['ob0', 'ob1', 'ob2']
    >>> list(ob.id for ob in container.findSources(
    ...     app['ob5'], filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy))
    []

`findRelationships`

    >>> len(list(container.findRelationships(
    ...     app['ob0'], app['ob4'], maxDepth=None)))
    2
    >>> len(list(container.findRelationships(
    ...     app['ob0'], app['ob4'], maxDepth=None,
    ...     filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy)))
    1
    >>> len(list(container.findRelationships(app['ob0'])))
    3
    >>> len(list(container.findRelationships(
    ...     app['ob0'], filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy)))
    2

`isLinked`

    >>> container.isLinked(app['ob0'], app['ob5'], maxDepth=None)
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(
    ...     app['ob0'], app['ob5'], maxDepth=None,
    ...     filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy)
    False
    >>> container.isLinked(
    ...     app['ob0'], app['ob2'], maxDepth=None,
    ...     filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy)
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(
    ...     app['ob0'], app['ob4'])
    True
    >>> container.isLinked(
    ...     app['ob0'], app['ob4'],
    ...     filter=ISpecialInterface.providedBy)
    False

Multiple Sources and/or Targets; Duplicate Relationships
--------------------------------------------------------

Relationships are not always between a single source and a single target.  Many
approaches to this are possible, but a simple one is to allow relationships to
have multiple sources and multiple targets.  This is an approach that the
relationship container supports.

    >>> container.append(Relationship(
    ...     (app['ob2'], app['ob4'], app['ob5'], app['ob6'], app['ob7']),
    ...     (app['ob1'], app['ob4'], app['ob8'], app['ob9'], app['ob10'])))
    >>> container.append(Relationship(
    ...     (app['ob10'], app['ob0']),
    ...     (app['ob7'], app['ob3'])))

Before we examine the results, look at those for a second.

Among the interesting items is that we have duplicated the ob2->ob4
relationship in the first example, and duplicated the ob0->ob3 relationship
in the second.  The relationship container does not limit duplicate
relationships: it simply adds and indexes them, and will include the additional
relationship path in findRelationships.

    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob4']))
    ['ob1', 'ob10', 'ob4', 'ob8', 'ob9']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob10']))
    ['ob3', 'ob7']
    >>> sorted(o.id for o in container.findTargets(app['ob4'], maxDepth=2))
    ['ob1', 'ob10', 'ob2', 'ob3', 'ob4', 'ob7', 'ob8', 'ob9']
    >>> sorted(
    ...     [repr(rel) for rel in path]
    ...     for path in container.findRelationships(
    ...         app['ob2'], app['ob4']))
    ...     # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [['<Relationship from 
       (<Demo ob2>, <Demo ob4>, <Demo ob5>, <Demo ob6>, <Demo ob7>)
       to
       (<Demo ob1>, <Demo ob4>, <Demo ob8>, <Demo ob9>, <Demo ob10>)>'],
     ['<Relationship from (<Demo ob2>,) to (<Demo ob4>,)>']]

There's also a reflexive relationship in there, with ob4 pointing to ob4.  It's
marked as a cycle.

    >>> list(container.findRelationships(app['ob4'], app['ob4']))
    ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [cycle(<Relationship from 
       (<Demo ob2>, <Demo ob4>, <Demo ob5>, <Demo ob6>, <Demo ob7>)
       to
       (<Demo ob1>, <Demo ob4>, <Demo ob8>, <Demo ob9>, <Demo ob10>)>,)]
    >>> list(container.findRelationships(app['ob4'], app['ob4']))[0].cycled
    [{'source': <Demo ob4>}]
